This assignment served as an inaugural project for familiarization with verilog. It incorporated writing modules, reference 'oracles' and test benches, as well as methods to exhaustively test all parts.

\section{General Approach}
There are two operations necessary to complete the task assigned: addition, and division. Luckily, the division is by 2, so we are able to change the scope of valid bits to preform the task. 

The addition was accomplished with 8 full adders assembled into one ripple carry adder. In order to round up, a one must be added onto the existing sum before division. This is done by feeding a \texttt{1} into the carry in of the ripple carry adder.

Bit slicing was preformed in order to accommodate the division, resulting in only looking at the high 7 bits. This however, limits our range. To ensure we can add numbers who's sum exceeds 255, the carry out from the ripple adder is set as the new MSB.
